WWW-Netflix version 0.05 README.test
==================================


HOW TO CREATE A TEST ACCOUNT

In order to run the WWW-Netflix tests, you need to have a test Netflix 
profile where you do not care about the ratings. You can create a profile 
that has 0 movies allotted to it, so it won't affect your normal Netflix 
operations. To create one, 
 1) Log into your main Netflix account.
 2) Click the "Your Account" link at the top. 
 3) In the "Account Preferences" area, click "Add Profile." 

Next, set some environment variables that point to this account.
 4) export NETFLIX_TEST_USER='login name'
 5) export NETFLIX_TEST_PASS='login password'

Now, we are ready to run tests.
 6) make test

Occassionally, some tests seem to fail due to sluggish updates of 
modified ratings or queue on the Netflix pages.
