WWW::Netflix version 0.05
==================================

Most people will just want to use the included netflix_mover program
to save or transfer ratings and queue data from Netflix profiles or
accounts.

This module is designed to pull down every movie that you've rated
within your Netflix account, as well as your queue. Once retrieved, the
information can be transferred to another Netflix account, if you
desire. The module utilizes the wonderful WWW::Mechanize module to work
its magic.

See the POD documentation for more info.
